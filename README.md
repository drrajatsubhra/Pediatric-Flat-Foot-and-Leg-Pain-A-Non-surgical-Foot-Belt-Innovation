  "description": "Flat foot (pes planus) is a common pediatric concern, often associated with leg pain, fatigue, and abnormal gait. This project presents an innovative, non-invasive, and affordable orthotic solution: a custom-designed felt and foam-based foot belt. Successfully applied in over 100 pediatric patients, the belt corrects the medial arch, redistributes midfoot load, and improves posture. Method: Customized felt straps with foam padding and Velcro fastening provide mid-foot support, stabilize the collapsed arch, and restore alignment during standing and walking. Transparent wrap may be used for fixation in children. Clinical Evidence: 1. Untreated pediatric flat foot (pre-treatment), 2. Orthotic belt in place with transparent wrap, 3. Post-treatment arch restoration and relief. Conclusion: This orthotic belt innovation, developed by Dr. Rajatsubhra Mukhopadhyay, demonstrates potential as a preventive and corrective tool in pediatric orthotic care.",

**Pediatric Flat Foot and Leg Pain â€“ A Non-surgical Foot Belt Innovation**  
By Dr. Rajatsubhra Mukhopadhyay (Child Health Care Arambag, West Bengal, India)

## ðŸ”¹ Background
Pediatric flat foot (*pes planus*) is a common condition where the medial plantar arch is absent, sometimes causing leg pain, fatigue, and altered gait.  
Conventional orthoses are expensive and not always accessible in rural practice.  

This project documents a **low-cost, non-surgical Foot Belt protocol** designed to support the arch, relieve pain, and improve gait.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Innovation Pathway

### Step 1 â€“ Clinical Observation
Flat foot confirmed by visual and weight-bearing inspection.  
![Flat Foot](m/,imag/flat_foot.jpg)  
*Figure 1. Flat foot showing absent medial arch.*

### Step 2 â€“ Trial with Foam & Tape
A temporary arch support using foam/cotton wrapped with cellotape.

### Step 3 â€“ Flat Foot Belt
A reusable strap-based device fabricated for daily use.
