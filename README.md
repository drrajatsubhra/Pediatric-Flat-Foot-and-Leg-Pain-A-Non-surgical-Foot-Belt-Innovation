**Pediatric Flat Foot and Leg Pain â€“ A Non-surgical Foot Belt Innovation**  
By Dr. Rajatsubhra Mukhopadhyay (Child Health Care Arambag, West Bengal, India)

## ðŸ”¹ Background
Pediatric flat foot (*pes planus*) is a common condition where the medial plantar arch is absent, sometimes causing leg pain, fatigue, and altered gait.  
Conventional orthoses are expensive and not always accessible in rural practice.  

This project documents a **low-cost, non-surgical Foot Belt protocol** designed to support the arch, relieve pain, and improve gait.

## ðŸ”¹ Innovation Pathway

### Step 1 â€“ Clinical Observation
Flat foot confirmed by visual and weight-bearing inspection.

*Figure 1. Flat foot showing absent medial arch.*

### Step 2 â€“ Trial with Foam & Tape
A temporary arch support using foam/cotton wrapped with cellotape.

### Step 3 â€“ Flat Foot Belt
A reusable strap-based device fabricated for daily use.
